    <h1>Building My First Website as a Security Geek</h1>
    <p>
      So, I finally did it. I had this idea floating around in my head for a while—build a website to tell a story.
      Not just any story, though. My story. About tech, security, and all the weird stuff I get into...
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Hand-Coding My Website to Learn More Programming</strong></h2>
    <p>
      When I set out to make a simple website, my first question was: what’s the most efficient and secure way to build it? 
      Static site generators are a popular option, so I looked into them. Jekyll came up right away, but since it requires 
      Ruby—and Ruby has a reputation for multiple security vulnerabilities—I wasn’t comfortable using it. Instead of depending
      on a generator, I decided to hand-code my site. This way, I could both keep things lightweight and sharpen my programming
      skills by understanding exactly how everything works under the hood.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>The Essentials I Needed</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IDE:</strong> VS Code (lightweight and efficient)</li>
      <li><strong>Languages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML – for structuring the content</li>
          <li>CSS – to make it not look like a 1998 Geocities site</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Getting the Site Online</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Once I had my site hand-coded, the next step was figuring out how to make it publicly accessible.
      Since it was just static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I didn’t need a heavy hosting solution—just somewhere reliable
      to serve the files. After looking at different options, I chose GitHub Pages because it’s free, secure, and integrates
      nicely with version control. Setting it up gave me a chance to learn about pushing code to a repository, managing branches,
      and configuring a custom domain. Deploying through GitHub Pages not only got my site online quickly, 
      but also taught me more about the workflow developers actually use when maintaining real projects.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Security First, Always</strong></h2>
    <p>
      While coding the site, I also kept security in mind. That meant being careful about which libraries I used,
      sticking to well-maintained ones, and keeping my dependencies minimal. I also made sure to configure GitHub 
      repository permissions properly and set up a secure .gitignore so that no sensitive files or credentials could 
      accidentally get pushed online.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2>
    Building my first website wasn’t just about HTML tags and CSS styles—it was an exercise in learning. 
    From deciding not to use Jekyll because of Ruby’s security concerns, to hand-coding every page for the sake of understanding,
    to deploying on GitHub Pages with a focus on safe practices, the whole process gave me both a working site and a stronger 
    foundation in programming and security.
